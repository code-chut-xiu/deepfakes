This project is to play with Python computer-vision and image libraries in the pursuit of learning how to effectively detect a deepfake.
In this project, my python3 version is 3.12.3, so I need to make sure that my intepreter version is set to (venv) 3.12.3

# Set up
- python3 -m venv venv
- source venv/bin/activate
- pip install -r requirements.txt
